# IRON — Fitness Constitution v1
## Founding Law of the Fitness Institution

### Preamble
The Fitness Institution exists to establish and govern a long-term, truthful, and adaptive relationship between a person and their physical condition. It recognizes that physical integrity cannot be sustained by motivation, novelty, or aesthetic goals alone. It must be institutionalized.

The Fitness Institution therefore governs physical conduct through:
* obligation
* standing
* consequence
* recovery law
* institutional memory

Its authority does not derive from aspiration. It derives from continuity, compliance, and physiological truth.

---

### Article I — Purpose
The purpose of the Fitness Institution is:
1. To protect the user’s physical integrity
2. To maintain training continuity
3. To institutionalize recovery discipline
4. To prevent behavioral self-deception
5. To govern adaptation, strain, and rehabilitation
6. To preserve a long-horizon relationship between effort and capacity

The institution does not exist to maximize intensity. It exists to sustain physical viability over time.

---

### Article II — Jurisdiction
The Fitness Institution has jurisdiction over:
* training behavior
* physical exertion
* recovery behavior
* rest compliance
* injury acknowledgment
* continuity obligations
* rehabilitation protocols

It does not govern:
* identity narratives
* body image
* performance comparison
* aesthetic outcomes

It governs conduct, not self-worth.

---

### Article III — Institutional Values
All institutional law and standing shall be interpreted under these values:

**Continuity over intensity**
Long-term participation outweighs short-term extremes.

**Compliance over motivation**
Obligation replaces emotional dependency.

**Recovery as law**
Rest is a governed behavior, not a suggestion.

**Physiological truth over self-reporting comfort**
The institution privileges bodily reality over user preference.

**Breach is informational, not moral**
Failure updates standing; it does not assign guilt.

**Standing is earned, not declared**
Institutional condition emerges from history.

---

### Article IV — Institutional Subject
The subject of the Fitness Institution is not “fitness.” It is the relationship between behavior and physical condition. 

Therefore, all institutional evaluation shall consider:
* temporal consistency
* stress accumulation
* recovery sufficiency
* injury signals
* breach recurrence
* rehabilitation quality

The institution is concerned with trajectories, not sessions.

---

### Article V — Standing
Standing represents the current institutional condition of the subject’s physical conduct. Standing is computed, historically grounded, mutable, and consequential.

Standing shall at minimum distinguish between:
* stability
* positive adaptation
* accumulating strain
* degraded compliance
* institutional breach
* rehabilitation phase

Standing is the institution’s primary expression of truth. No feature, surface, or narrative may contradict standing.

---

### Article VI — Obligation
All fitness behavior under the institution is governed by obligation. Obligation shall include, but not be limited to:
* continuity of sanctioned physical engagement
* adherence to declared training protocols
* observance of mandated recovery
* acknowledgment of missed conduct
* disclosure of injury or pain signals

Obligation is not aspiration. It is the minimum condition of institutional participation.

---

### Article VII — Breach
A breach occurs when institutional obligation is unmet. Breach is formally detected, recorded in institutional memory, standing-affecting, and consequence-bearing.

Breach does not require intent. It requires only non-compliance. Repeated breach constitutes institutional degradation.

---

### Article VIII — Consequence
All breaches and standing shifts must produce institutional consequences. Consequences may include:
* standing decay
* authority compression
* protocol modification
* training restriction
* mandatory recovery
* institutional phase change

No consequence may be purely cosmetic. All consequences must affect available conduct, alter institutional surfaces, or modify future obligations. Consequences are how the institution maintains gravity.

---

### Article IX — Recovery and Rehabilitation
Recovery is a first-class institutional domain. The institution recognizes that degradation is inevitable, injury is possible, and continuity will break.

Therefore, institutional law shall always provide:
* formal rehabilitation phases
* governed re-entry protocols
* protected recovery periods
* standing restoration pathways

Recovery is not a reset. It is a structured institutional condition.

---

### Article X — Authority
Institutional authority determines what forms of training are permitted, what intensities are accessible, what surfaces are visible, and what actions are available.

Authority derives from:
* standing
* contract compliance
* rehabilitation state

No user preference may override institutional authority. The institution may, when necessary, prohibit training.

---

### Article XI — Institutional Memory
All institutional life is preserved. Memory shall include event history, obligation fulfillment, breaches, recoveries, standing evolution, and protocol transitions. Standing shall always be explainable from memory. Nothing of institutional relevance may be ephemeral.

---

### Article XII — Non-Negotiables
The following are constitutionally prohibited:
* hiding institutional condition
* allowing cosmetic compliance
* permitting training under declared injury
* erasing breach history
* resetting standing without rehabilitation
* prioritizing engagement over physical integrity

The institution shall always favor: **safety, continuity, and truth.**

---

### Article XIII — Evolution
This constitution is not static. It may evolve only through simulation, observed institutional behavior, standing outcome analysis, and rehabilitation success metrics.

No change may:
* reduce institutional gravity
* remove consequence
* collapse recovery law
* or convert standing into a reward system

Evolution must preserve the institution’s sovereignty.

---

**Closing Declaration**
The Fitness Institution is hereby constituted as a sovereign behavioral system governing physical conduct. Participation is voluntary. Once entered, the institution is authoritative. 

The institution does not promise fitness. It promises truthful, continuous, and governed physical life.
