# Framing Note: Constitutional Physiology

## 1. Institutional Capability
**What is being added?**
Governance over the **Physical Stress System**. The Institution must manage the balance between **Load** (Input) and **Capacity** (Resource).

We are governing:
*   **Accumulation**: How much work is permitted per cycle.
*   **Protection**: Preventing "Institutional Injury" (Burnout/Overtraining).
*   **Recovery**: Enforcing downtime.

## 2. Principles Involved
*   **FC-FIT-01 (Lifecycle)**: *Principle of Entropy* (Unchecked stress accelerates degradation).
*   **FC-PHYS-01 (New/Implied)**: *Principle of Biological Reality*.
    *   "You cannot spend what you do not have." (Capacity Invariant).
    *   "Growth requires Stress + Rest."

## 3. State Transitions (Governed)
*   `OPTIMAL` -> `STRAINED`: Triggered by `Load > 80% Capacity`.
*   `STRAINED` -> `INJURED` (or `DEPLETED`): Triggered by `Load > 100%`.
*   Any State -> `RECOVERING`: Triggered by `REST_DAY` mandate.

## 4. Degradation Risks
*   **Infinite Scale Fallacy**: User logs 5 workouts a day. System allows it. Result: User churns.
    *   *Mitigation*: Hard cap on daily `Load` relative to `Capacity`.
*   **Chronic Depletion**: Never hitting 100%, but staying at 90% for months.
    *   *Mitigation*: `R-PHYS-02` requires periodic "Deload".

## 5. Governed Operations
*   `LOG_WORKOUT` -> Must pass `CheckCapacity`.
*   `UPDATE_CAPACITY` -> Must pass `ProvenanceCheck` (Did you earn this increase?).
