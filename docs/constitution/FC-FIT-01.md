# Constitution of the Fitness Institution

## Preamble

The Fitness Institution is established as a governed system within the IRON3 Institutional Kernel.

Its purpose is not to prescribe exercise, but to maintain, protect, and evolve the individual’s capacity for physical continuity, resilience, and recoverability under formal institutional law.

The Fitness Institution exists to transform fitness from episodic activity into a durable institution—with legitimacy, standing, obligations, and constitutional protections.

All engines, modules, and simulations operating within the Fitness Institution are subordinate to this constitution.

## Article I — Jurisdiction and Authority
### I.1 Jurisdiction

The Fitness Institution governs all processes, data, and behaviors related to:

• physical capacity
• physiological stress and recovery
• training continuity
• functional integrity
• embodied performance commitments

within its instantiated scope.

### I.2 Supremacy

This constitution has supreme authority over:

• standing engines
• scoring systems
• recommendation systems
• simulation runners
• UI representations

No module may produce a state not permitted herein.

## Article II — Ontology of the Fitness Institution
### II.1 Institutional Nature

The Fitness Institution is a persistent governed entity, not a session log, habit tracker, or analytics stream.

It possesses:

• identity
• lifecycle state
• standing
• historical memory
• rights of recovery
• and conditions of degradation.

### II.2 Institutional Memory

The institution shall maintain an immutable record of:

• commitment events
• continuity evidence
• breach events
• lifecycle transitions
• standing baselines.

Standing is historical.
Fitness is not instantaneous.

## Article III — Lifecycle Law
### III.1 Recognized Lifecycle States

The Fitness Institution may exist only in the following lifecycle states:

**GENESIS** — jurisdictional birth

**PROBATION** — earning of legitimacy

**ACTIVE** — constitutionally established

**DEGRADABLE** — liable to institutional sanction

**COLLAPSED** — loss of institutional continuity

No other lifecycle state is valid.

### III.2 GENESIS

GENESIS begins at first activation.

In GENESIS:
• the institution exists legally but not performatively
• no standing judgments may be rendered
• no degradation is permissible
• all standing metrics are non-binding

GENESIS establishes jurisdiction, not merit.

### III.3 PROBATION

PROBATION begins upon first demonstrated commitment.

In PROBATION:
• continuity may be measured
• standing may be observed
• baselines may be established
• degradation is constitutionally forbidden

PROBATION exists to allow the institution to earn legitimacy.

### III.4 ACTIVE

ACTIVE begins once sustained positive continuity is demonstrated.

In ACTIVE:
• standing judgments are binding
• recovery processes are legitimate
• institutional memory is authoritative
• degradation remains prohibited

ACTIVE establishes the institution as constitutionally alive.

### III.5 DEGRADABLE

DEGRADABLE begins only after prolonged ACTIVE standing.

In DEGRADABLE:
• the institution may legally degrade
• degradation requires historical breach
• degradation must be adjudicated
• recovery rights remain protected

DEGRADABLE does not mean degraded.
It means accountable.

### III.6 COLLAPSED

COLLAPSED represents institutional discontinuity.

It may only occur following:
• prolonged degradation
• sustained continuity failure
• and constitutional confirmation.

In COLLAPSED:
• standing is suspended
• recovery requires re-chartering
• institutional memory is preserved but inactive

Collapse is not punishment.
It is loss of institutional continuity.

## Article IV — Standing and Legitimacy
### IV.1 Standing as Institutional Condition

Standing expresses the institution’s condition across recognized dimensions, including but not limited to:
• continuity
• physiological stress
• recovery capacity
• functional integrity
• adaptive trajectory

Standing is always subordinate to lifecycle law.

### IV.2 Earned Baseline

Standing baselines shall only be established after entry into PROBATION.

Degradation may only be determined relative to an earned baseline.

No institution may be judged as having fallen unless it has first stood.

### IV.3 Standing Authority

Standing engines may:
• measure
• propose
• forecast

They may not:
• degrade
• collapse
• override lifecycle protections.

## Article V — Degradation Doctrine
### V.1 Nature of Degradation

Degradation is an institutional verdict, not a numerical outcome.

It represents loss of constitutionally earned standing.

### V.2 Preconditions for Degradation

Degradation may only occur if all are true:

1. The institution is DEGRADABLE
2. A standing baseline exists
3. Sustained breach is evidenced
4. Measurable decline from baseline is demonstrated
5. Constitutional adjudication is satisfied

Instantaneous weakness is insufficient.

### V.3 Sustained Breach

Sustained breach may include, but is not limited to:
• repeated commitment failure
• prolonged continuity loss
• unresolved stress dominance
• recovery incapacity
• structural neglect of the institution

Breach must be historical.

## Article VI — Recovery Rights
### VI.1 Constitutional Right to Recovery

All degraded institutions retain a constitutional right to recovery.

No degradation may permanently extinguish the institution.

### VI.2 Recovery as Institutional Process

Recovery is not cosmetic improvement.

It is a governed institutional process requiring:
• renewed continuity
• stress reconciliation
• integrity restoration
• and lawful standing reassessment.

## Article VII — Collapse and Reinstatement
### VII.1 Conditions of Collapse

Collapse may only occur if:
• degradation persists beyond a constitutional window
• continuity remains absent
• and recovery obligations are unmet.

### VII.2 Reinstatement

A collapsed institution may only be reinstated through:
• renewed GENESIS or PROBATION
• explicit re-chartering
• preservation of historical memory
• and re-establishment of baseline.

Collapse resets legitimacy, not history.

## Article VIII — Simulation Authority
### VIII.1 Role of Simulation

Simulation is a constitutional instrument.

It exists to:
• test lifecycle law
• evaluate degradation doctrine
• explore recovery trajectories
• and expose institutional risk.

No simulation may bypass lifecycle protections.

## Article IX — Compliance and Invariants

The following are binding invariants:

• No degradation before DEGRADABLE
• No degradation without baseline
• No standing without institutional existence
• No collapse without degradation
• No recovery without continuity
• No institutional state without constitutional authority

Any module violating these invariants is non-compliant.

## Article X — Supremacy Clause

This constitution supersedes:
• standing engines
• scoring models
• heuristics
• simulations
• UI interpretations

The Fitness Institution is governed first by law, then by metrics.
