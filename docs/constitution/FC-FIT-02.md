# FC-FIT-02
# Degradation and Recovery Code of the Fitness Institution

## Preamble

This code operationalizes the Degradation Doctrine and Recovery Rights defined in FC-FIT-01.

It exists to ensure that institutional failure, stress, and weakness are treated as governed states, not as algorithmic side effects.

No degradation may occur outside the procedures herein defined.

## Article I — Definitions
### I.1 Degradation

Degradation is the constitutional condition in which the Fitness Institution is adjudicated to have suffered a material and sustained loss of earned standing.

It is not synonymous with fatigue, injury, or temporary incapacity.

### I.2 Recovery

Recovery is the constitutional process by which a degraded Fitness Institution lawfully reconstitutes its standing.

Recovery is an institutional process, not merely physiological improvement.

### I.3 Breach

A breach is a constitutionally relevant failure of institutional obligation, including:
• continuity failure
• unresolved stress dominance
• abandonment of commitment
• or sustained neglect of recovery.

## Article II — Preconditions of Degradation

No degradation proceeding may begin unless all are satisfied:

1. Lifecycle state is DEGRADABLE
2. An earned baseline exists
3. The institution has previously occupied ACTIVE standing
4. A breach investigation window is open
5. Historical signals indicate sustained breach

If any precondition is absent, degradation is legally impossible.

## Article III — Evidentiary Standard

Degradation requires convergent evidence.

No single metric is sufficient.

At minimum, two of the following classes must be satisfied.

### III.1 Continuity Breach
Examples:
• ≥ N missed constitutionally defined commitments
• continuity index below threshold for T days
• absence of legitimate institutional activity

### III.2 Stress Dominance
Examples:
• stress vector exceeds recovery vector for T days
• unresolved overload signals
• physiological destabilization without reconciliation

### III.3 Standing Loss
Examples:
• current SI below (baselineSI − Δ)
• downward standing slope over a defined horizon
• multi-vector deterioration

### III.4 Integrity Failure
Examples:
• injury state without recovery protocol
• repeated aborted commitments
• structural non-compliance with institution rules

### III.5 Adjudicative Confirmation
The compliance layer must confirm:
• breach persistence
• absence of active recovery
• and constitutional eligibility.

## Article IV — Degradation Adjudication
### IV.1 Provisional Degradation

When evidentiary conditions are met, the institution enters:

**PROVISIONAL DEGRADATION**

In this state:
• standing is constrained
• recovery protocols are invoked
• collapse counters may begin
• but degradation is not yet final.

This prevents instantaneous condemnation.

### IV.2 Ratified Degradation

If provisional degradation persists beyond the constitutional window:
• without recovery trajectory
• and without breach resolution

then degradation is ratified.

The institution is formally DEGRADED.

This transition must be recorded immutably.

## Article V — Rights and Obligations in Degradation

When DEGRADED:

The institution retains:
• identity
• historical memory
• right to recovery
• simulation support
• and constitutional protections.

The institution is subject to:
• restricted standing escalation
• bounded stress tolerance
• mandatory recovery governance
• collapse evaluation windows.

Degradation is a protected state, not a penalty.

## Article VI — Recovery Code
### VI.1 Initiation of Recovery

Recovery begins when:
• new continuity evidence is established
• stress is constitutionally reconciled
• or recovery protocols are activated.

Recovery may occur in:
• provisional degradation
• ratified degradation.

### VI.2 Recovery Phases

Recovery proceeds through governed phases:

1. **STABILIZATION**
2. **RECONSTITUTION**
3. **REINTEGRATION**
4. **REVALIDATION**

#### 1. Stabilization
Objectives:
• halt standing decline
• cap stress dominance
• re-establish institutional activity.
No standing gains are yet authoritative.

#### 2. Reconstitution
Objectives:
• rebuild continuity
• restore recovery capacity
• reverse breach signals.
A recovery baseline may be provisionally set.

#### 3. Reintegration
Objectives:
• re-enter lawful standing evaluation
• allow standing improvement
• permit upward band transitions.
Degradation status remains until completion.

#### 4. Revalidation
Objectives:
• demonstrate sustained positive trajectory
• satisfy continuity thresholds
• confirm recovery stability.
Upon completion, degradation may be lifted.

### VI.3 Lifting Degradation

Degradation may be lifted only if:
• breach signals are resolved
• recovery trajectory is sustained
• and standing exceeds constitutional recovery threshold.

The institution re-enters ACTIVE standing.

## Article VII — Collapse Doctrine
### VII.1 Conditions of Collapse

Collapse proceedings may begin if:
• ratified degradation persists beyond C days
• continuity remains absent
• and recovery obligations are unmet.

### VII.2 Collapse Adjudication

Collapse requires:
• constitutional review
• absence of recovery trajectory
• and sustained institutional non-existence.

Collapse is never automatic.

### VII.3 Effects of Collapse

When COLLAPSED:
• standing engines are suspended
• degradation ceases to evolve
• recovery must be re-chartered
• institutional memory is sealed.

Collapse is ontological discontinuity.

## Article VIII — Simulation Authority

Simulation may:
• explore degradation scenarios
• test recovery doctrine
• evaluate collapse thresholds.

Simulation may not:
• bypass evidentiary standards
• force degradation
• override recovery rights.

## Article IX — Compliance Invariants

The following are binding:

• No instantaneous degradation
• No degradation without breach
• No breach without history
• No collapse without prolonged degradation
• No recovery without continuity
• No reinstatement without revalidation

Any engine violating these is constitutionally invalid.

## Article X — Supremacy Clause

This code binds:
• standing engines
• evaluators
• compliance modules
• simulation runners
• UI verdicts.

All degradation and recovery behavior must be traceable to this code.
