# IRON3 Architecture: The Sovereign Kernel
## Executive Technical Narrative (v1.0)

### The Problem: Rule-Soup
Most fitness and behavioral applications suffer from "Rule-Soup"—logic is scattered across UI components, database triggers, and backend controllers. This makes the system fragile, easily gamed, and impossible to audit.

### The Solution: Constitutional Sovereignty
IRON3 introduces a **Constitutional Kernel**. This is a dedicated, sovereign software layer that centralizes all institutional logic into a single, immutable repository of "Life Laws."

#### 1. The Kernel (The Brain)
Instead of engines deciding their own fates, they must "petition" the Kernel via the **Compliance Gate**.
- **Rules as Code**: Invariants like "No promotion without integrity" are written as functional validators.
- **Decoupled Enforcement**: The user's standing or biological load isn't a variable in some object; it's a **Constitutional Condition** adjudicated by the Kernel.

#### 2. The Ledger (The Memory)
Every major decision—whether a belt promotion is allowed or a high-stress session is blocked—is recorded in an append-only **Audit Ledger**. This creates an unalterable "Truth Stream" of institutional behavior.

#### 3. The Lifecycle (The Journey)
IRON3 doesn't just track data; it manages a **Lifecycle**. An institution moves from `GENESIS` to `PROBATION` to `ACTIVE` only when empirical evidence of consistency is provided. If the institution fails, it enters a governed `DEGRADED` state with mandatory recovery protocols.

### Why It Matters for Partners
- **Integrity**: The system is gamed-proof. Standing (Belts) must be earned and verified.
- **Safety**: Physiological limits are core laws, not just UI warnings.
- **Traceability**: Every state change has a constitutional citation. 

**IRON3 isn't just an app; it's a governed digital institution.**
