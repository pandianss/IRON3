# IRON — Component Constitution

**Version**: 1.0
**Scope**: Defines the authorized UI primitives, their jurisdictions, visual rules, and behavioral obligations.

## 1. Constitutional Principle

IRON’s interface is not a collection of widgets.
It is a visible institutional structure.

Every component must:
*   **Belong to a jurisdiction**
*   **Express institutional state**
*   **Encode time or obligation**
*   **Obey the standing system**
*   *No neutral components are permitted.*

## 2. Jurisdictional Layers

All components belong to one of four constitutional layers:
1.  **Authority Layer** — What governs
2.  **Obligation Layer** — What is owed
3.  **Temporal Layer** — What has occurred
4.  **Human Layer** — What supports

*No component may cross layers.*

## 3. Authorized Primitives

### A. Authority Layer Components
*These define institutional condition.*

**A1. Standing Banner**
*   **Role**: Declares the current institutional state.
*   **Must display**: Standing label, Standing value or class, Today’s jurisdiction.
*   **Visual law**: Always above the fold, Largest typographic authority, Standing overlay source.
*   **Behavioral law**: Re-renders only on evaluation, Triggers chromatic shift, Cannot be dismissed.

**A2. Verdict Panel**
*   **Role**: Institutional explanation.
*   **Used for**: Daily evaluation result, Breach declaration, Recovery declaration.
*   **Visual law**: Framed, not carded, Clear entry motion, High contrast separation.
*   **Behavioral law**: Appears only on state transitions, Must acknowledge history or consequence.

**A3. Institutional Seal**
*   **Role**: Permanent system identity.
*   **Used for**: App identity, Ledger marks, Major milestones.
*   **Visual law**: Minimalist, geometric, Not decorative, Not clickable.
*   *This is not a logo. This is a stamp.*

### B. Obligation Layer Components
*These represent active governance.*

**B1. Obligation Stack**
*   **Role**: Displays today’s active behavioral contracts.
*   **Must show**: What is required, What decays, What completes today.
*   **Visual law**: Vertical pressure, Ordered by consequence, Entry from below.
*   **Behavioral law**: Items must feel pending, Completion removes surface, Cannot feel collectible.

**B2. Contract Card**
*   **Role**: A single binding requirement.
*   **Must encode**: Action, Time sensitivity, Risk weight.
*   **Visual law**: Framed, Progression visible, State-sensitive edges.
*   **Behavioral law**: Completion triggers institutional response, Failure triggers degradation markers.

**B3. Compliance Control**
*   **Role**: Mechanism to satisfy obligation.
*   **Examples**: Workout confirmation, Check-in action, Proof submission.
*   **Visual law**: Physically grounded, Deliberate affordance, No playful toggles.
*   **Behavioral law**: Must acknowledge acceptance, Must invoke ledger mutation.

### C. Temporal Layer Components
*These preserve continuity.*

**C1. Continuity Band**
*   **Role**: Visualizes uninterrupted adherence.
*   **Must show**: Extension of streak, Breaks, Seasonality.
*   **Visual law**: Horizontal persistence, Always growing or fragmenting.
*   **Behavioral law**: Only grows forward, Breaks leave visible scars.

**C2. Institutional Ledger**
*   **Role**: Immutable historical record.
*   **Used for**: Breaches, Streaks, Major milestones.
*   **Visual law**: Chronological gravity, Desaturation with age, Embedded (not floating).
*   **Behavioral law**: Append-only, Never re-ordered, Never animated out.

**C3. Scar Marker**
*   **Role**: Visual representation of irreversible failure.
*   **Visual law**: Low saturation, Fractured geometry, Background-embedded.
*   **Behavioral law**: Never deletable, Never hidden, Only contextualized.

**C4. Decay Indicator**
*   **Role**: Shows degrading commitments.
*   **Visual law**: Subtle motion, Tension cues, Color destabilization.
*   **Behavioral law**: Must worsen if ignored, Must calm if acted upon.

### D. Human Layer Components
*These support the user inside the institution.*

**D1. Reflection Field**
*   **Role**: Human meaning capture (Journaling).
*   **Visual law**: Softest surface, Reduced contrast, Isolated from authority.
*   **Behavioral law**: Never blocks governance, Never dominates screens.

**D2. Guidance Panel**
*   **Role**: System interpretation (Onboarding).
*   **Visual law**: Clearly secondary, Calm typography, Non-reactive to standing.

**D3. Advisory Prompt**
*   **Role**: Light directional nudges.
*   **Visual law**: Brief, Peripheral, Never modal unless breach.

## 4. Foundational Primitives (Non-negotiable)

These are not “components.” They are system objects.

**F1. Standing Theme Adapter**
*   Consumes engine state and outputs: CSS variables, Motion intensity, Accent channels.
*   All visual systems subscribe to it.

**F2. Institutional Clock**
*   Controls: Daily evaluation, Decay rate, Ledger transitions.
*   *No UI element may simulate time.*

**F3. Ledger Interface**
*   The only legal way to write history.

## 5. Composition Law

Screens are not layouts. They are **institutional scenes**.
Every scene must include:
1.  One authority component
2.  One obligation or temporal component
3.  One explicit time reference

## 6. Behavioral Guarantees

Every authorized component must:
*   Reflect standing changes automatically
*   Encode time sensitivity visually
*   Degrade or evolve with inactivity
*   Produce an institutional response when used
*   *If a component does not change over time, it does not belong.*

## 7. Component Audit Checklist

A component is unconstitutional if:
*   It could exist in another app unchanged
*   It does not express authority, time, or obligation
*   It only decorates or organizes
*   It does not change with standing
*   It can be removed without perceptual loss
