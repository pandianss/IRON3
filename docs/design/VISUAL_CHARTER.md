# IRON — Visual Language Charter

**Version**: 1.0
**Purpose**: Define a binding visual, kinetic, and perceptual system for IRON such that every screen expresses authority, continuity, and institutional state.

## 1. Core Visual Philosophy

IRON is not a wellness product.
IRON is a personal institution.

The interface must not optimize for “pleasantness.”
It must optimize for:

*   **Authority**
*   **Legibility of standing**
*   **Temporal gravity**
*   **Behavioral pressure**
*   **Visible continuity**

Every visual layer must answer one question:
> “What is my institutional condition right now?”

## 2. Perceptual Pillars

All design decisions must reinforce these five pillars.

### 2.1 Authority over decoration
UI elements exist because they serve governance.
No ornamental visuals without institutional meaning.
*   **Hard edges** preferred over soft.
*   **Framing** preferred over floating.
*   **Deliberate spacing** over aesthetic whitespace.
*   *The system watches. The system persists.*

### 2.2 State visibility over aesthetic consistency
Consistency is subordinate to standing legibility.
*   If standing changes, the interface must visibly change.
*   A user should sense institutional drift without reading text.

### 2.3 Time as a physical presence
Days must accumulate visually.
The UI must show:
*   What is irreversible
*   What is degrading
*   What is compounding
*   *If time is not felt, habit collapses.*

### 2.4 Tension before reward
The UI must encode:
*   Risk
*   Obligation
*   Fragility
*   Relief
*   *Never only positivity.*
A system without tension becomes ignorable.

### 2.5 Human inside institution
Despite authority, the interface must remain:
*   Calm
*   Non-hostile
*   Non-chaotic
*   *The system governs behavior, not dignity.*

## 3. Chromatic System (Color Law)

Color is not branding.
Color is institutional telemetry.

### 3.1 Core Neutrals (infrastructure layer)
Always present. Independent of standing.
Used for: Backgrounds, Primary surfaces, Text, Structural dividers.
*   **Properties**: Dark, low-saturation, Long-session safe, Emotionally cold.
*   *This is the building.*

### 3.2 Standing Overlays (state layer)
Standing overlays tint, illuminate, and energize the infrastructure.
They control: Accent colors, Subtle gradients, Focus rings, Progress indicators, System highlights.

**Example canonical bands:**
*   **STABLE**: Order, continuity (Cool, controlled)
*   **ASCENDING**: Momentum, expansion (Fresh, luminous)
*   **RISK**: Fragility, decay (Heated, unstable)
*   **BREACH**: Failure, rupture (Sharp, high contrast)
*   **RECOVERY**: Repair, re-entry (Dim, reconstructive)

**Rules:**
*   Only one standing band may dominate at a time.
*   Standing overlay must affect the whole app.
*   Accent color must never be neutral.
*   *Color drift = institutional drift.*

### 3.3 Semantic Color Channels
Beyond standing overlays, fixed channels exist:
*   **Success** = compliance completion
*   **Warning** = approaching breach
*   **Scar** = irreversible past event
*   **Obligation** = future-bound pressure

They must not clash with standing bands. Standing always wins.

## 4. Geometry & Spatial Law

IRON’s layout expresses power structure.

### 4.1 Surfaces must have jurisdiction
There are only four legitimate surface types:
1.  **Authority Surfaces**: Standing, Verdicts, Institutional state
2.  **Obligation Surfaces**: Today’s commitments, Pending requirements
3.  **Temporal Surfaces**: Streaks, Ledgers, Scars, History
4.  **Human Surfaces**: Reflection, Guidance, Explanation

Every container must belong to one of these. No generic cards.

### 4.2 Vertical hierarchy
Spatial hierarchy is law hierarchy.
*   **Top** = institutional authority
*   **Middle** = present obligations
*   **Bottom** = historical record
*   *Scrolling down should feel like descending into time.*

### 4.3 Geometry rules
*   **Rectilinear base system**
*   **Controlled radius** (no bubbly rounding)
*   **Lines and frames** are preferred over shadows
*   **Borders imply jurisdiction**
*   **Overlaps imply conflict**
*   *Nothing should feel weightless.*

## 5. Typography Charter

Typography is the voice of the institution.

### 5.1 Typographic roles
There are only three allowed typographic classes.

**A. Institutional Voice**
Used for: Standing labels, Law statements, Status declarations, Section headers.
*   **Properties**: Neutral, Uppercase or small-caps acceptable, High clarity, Formal tone.

**B. Numeric Authority**
Used for: Day counts, Streaks, Standing values, Risk metrics, Obligation counts.
*   **Properties**: Large, Spatially isolated, Visually dominant, Treated as objects, not text.
*   *If these are small, the UI is wrong.*

**C. Human Layer**
Used for: Guidance, Explanation, Reflections, Educational content.
*   **Properties**: Softer, More readable, Emotionally supportive.
*   *This layer must never dominate the screen.*

### 5.2 Hierarchy enforcement
At any moment:
1.  One numeric authority may dominate.
2.  One institutional voice may frame.
3.  Human layer must remain subordinate.
If all three compete, redesign.

## 6. Motion & Kinetics Doctrine

Motion is not polish.
Motion is institutional response.

### 6.1 Motion only occurs on state change
Legitimate triggers: Daily evaluation, Obligation completion, Risk escalation, Breach, Recovery transition.
*   If nothing changed institutionally, nothing moves.

### 6.2 Motion language
*   **Evaluation**: Whole-app chromatic and tonal shift
*   **Completion**: Release, collapse, withdrawal
*   **Streak continuation**: Extension, addition
*   **Risk increase**: Pulse, tremor, shimmer
*   **Breach**: Interruption, snap, desaturation
*   **Recovery**: Slow reconstitution, fade-in
*   *No decorative loops. No constant motion.*

### 6.3 Directionality
*   **Future pressure** enters from below
*   **Authority** descends from above
*   **History** settles into the background
*   **Scars** never animate out

## 7. Temporal Visualization System

Time must be visible without charts.

### 7.1 Required time artifacts
IRON must always show:
*   Today’s jurisdiction
*   Active streak continuity
*   Historical permanence
*   Risk decay or growth
*   *At least one of these must be visible on every core screen.*

### 7.2 Visual aging
Historical objects must: Desaturate, Compress, Embed into background strata.
*   *Nothing in the past should look new.*

## 8. Interaction Law

Interaction is consent to governance.

### 8.1 Input gravity
User actions must feel: Deliberate, Confirmational, Binding.
*   **Avoid**: Tiny tap targets, Playful toggles, Instant gratification flashes.
*   **Prefer**: Press + hold confirmations, Institutional phrasing, State acknowledgements.

### 8.2 Completion ceremony
Every fulfilled obligation triggers: Visual removal, Temporal marking, Institutional acknowledgment.
*   *No silent successes.*

## 9. Anti-Patterns (Explicitly forbidden)

IRON must never resemble:
*   A social app
*   A gamified tracker
*   A motivational poster
*   A neon fitness UI
*   A soft productivity tool

**Specifically forbidden**: Confetti, Cartoon icons, Emoji semantics, Excessive gradients, Over-rounded UI kits, “Happy” color-only feedback.
*   *IRON is calm. Serious. Persistent.*

## 10. Design Acceptance Criteria

A screen may ship only if:
1.  Standing is perceptible without reading
2.  Time is visually encoded
3.  Numbers dominate where behavior is measured
4.  Motion only responds to institutional events
5.  Surfaces clearly belong to a jurisdiction
6.  The interface feels heavier tomorrow than today
