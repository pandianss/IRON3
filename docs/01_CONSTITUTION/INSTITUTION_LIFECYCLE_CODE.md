# INSTITUTIONAL LIFECYCLE CODE
## Law of Sovereignty, Degradation, and Recovery

### PREAMBLE
This Code defines the physics of the Institution. It establishes that the Institution is a living legal entity with a defined lifecycle, capable of earning legitimacy, suffering degradation, and undergoing collapse.
All engines, modules, and simulations must strictly adhere to these state definitions.

---

### ARTICLE I — LIFECYCLE STATES

The Institution may exist only in one of the following five states. No other state is valid.

#### 1. GENESIS (Jurisdictional Birth)
*   **Definition**: The state of initial creation. Existence is legal but not performative.
*   **Conditions**: First activation.
*   **Constraints**: No degradation permitted. Standing metrics are non-binding.

#### 2. PROBATION (Legitimacy Earning)
*   **Definition**: The period of demonstrating intent.
*   **Conditions**: Begins upon first commitment.
*   **Constraints**: Degradation forbidden. Baselines are being established.

#### 3. ACTIVE (Constitutionally Alive)
*   **Definition**: The state of sustained sovereignty.
*   **Conditions**: Sustained positive continuity demonstrated.
*   **Rights**: Standing judgments are binding. Institutional memory is authoritative.
*   **Protections**: Degradation prohibited until DEGRADABLE conditions are met.

#### 4. DEGRADABLE (Accountable)
*   **Definition**: The state of mature sovereignty where failure has consequence.
*   **Conditions**: Prolonged ACTIVE standing.
*   **Implication**: The institution may now legally degrade if breach occurs.

#### 5. COLLAPSED (Discontinuity)
*   **Definition**: Loss of institutional continuity.
*   **Conditions**: Prolonged degradation + continuity failure.
*   **Effects**: Standing suspended. Memory sealed. Reinstatement requires re-chartering.

---

### ARTICLE II — DEGRADATION DOCTRINE

Degradation is an institutional verdict, not a numerical outcome. It represents the loss of constitutionally earned standing.

#### II.1 Preconditions
Degradation may ONLY occur if:
1.  Lifecycle state is **DEGRADABLE**.
2.  An **Earned Baseline** exists.
3.  **Sustained Breach** is evidenced by historical record.

#### II.2 Evidentiary Standard
Degradation requires convergent evidence from multiple vectors:
*   **Continuity Breach**: Missed commitments beyond threshold.
*   **Stress Dominance**: Unresolved physiological or systemic debt.
*   **Standing Loss**: Measurable decline from baseline.

#### II.3 Ratification
If provisional degradation persists beyond the constitutional window without resolution, degradation is **RATIFIED**. The institution is formally DEGRADED.

---

### ARTICLE III — RECOVERY LAW

All degraded institutions retain a constitutional right to recovery. Recovery is a governed process, not a reset.

#### III.1 The Recovery Cycle
1.  **STABILIZATION**: Halt decline. Cap stress.
2.  **RECONSTITUTION**: Rebuild continuity. Restore capacity.
3.  **REINTEGRATION**: Re-enter lawful standing evaluation.
4.  **REVALIDATION**: Confirm stability. Lift degradation.

#### III.2 Lifting Degradation
Degradation is lifted ONLY when breach signals are resolved and standing exceeds the recovery threshold. The institution returns to **ACTIVE**.

---

### ARTICLE IV — COLLAPSE AND REINSTATEMENT

#### IV.1 Conditions of Collapse
Collapse occurs if ratified degradation persists beyond the constitutional window with zero continuity.

#### IV.2 Effects
*   All Standing Engines suspended.
*   Recovery rights revoked (requires re-charter).
*   Institutional Memory preserved but inactive.

#### IV.3 Reinstatement
A collapsed institution must undergo **Re-Induction**. It starts defined by its history but without its previous standing.

---

### ARTICLE V — COMPLIANCE INVARIANTS

Any module violating these invariants is non-compliant:
*   **No Degradation before DEGRADABLE.**
*   **No Degradation without Baseline.**
*   **No Collapse without Degradation.**
*   **No Recovery without Continuity.**
*   **No Institutional State without Constitutional Laws.**
