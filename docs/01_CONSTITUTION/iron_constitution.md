# THE IRON CONSTITUTION
## ESTABLISHED 2026 — SOVEREIGN DISCIPLINE SYSTEM

### PREAMBLE
IRON is not a habit tracker. IRON is a behavioural institution.
Its purpose is to establish, govern, and preserve personal discipline through enforceable commitments, permanent records, and escalating accountability.

### ARTICLE I — SOVEREIGNTY OF THE LEDGER
The Behavioural Ledger is the single source of truth. All user state must be derivable exclusively from ledger history. The ledger records only facts: events that have occurred under system authority.

### ARTICLE II — STANDING AS SUPREME AUTHORITY
Every user exists in exactly one Standing at any time. Standing governs what actions are permitted, what screens are accessible, and what tone the system adopts. If Standing cannot justify an experience, that experience must not exist.

### ARTICLE III — CONTRACTUAL ENTRY
Entry into IRON occurs only through Induction. A contract defines minimum obligations, evaluation rules, and failure conditions. Without a contract, no user is considered a member.

### ARTICLE IV — DAILY GOVERNANCE
IRON is organised around institutional days. Each day may create obligations. Every governed day must be closed by ledger entry. An open day is an unresolved institutional state.

### ARTICLE V — IRREVERSIBILITY
All institutional outcomes leave permanent record. Failures must produce historical facts. No mechanism may erase institutional history. Progress accumulates. Failure scars.

### ARTICLE VI — ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT
Continued compliance must increase institutional weight. Stability must never reduce consequence. Time strengthens authority.

### ARTICLE VII — BREACH AND RECOVERY
Breach is a formal institutional event. Recovery is not a reset; it is a governed process with defined cost. The system must always remember the difference between continuity and repair.

### ARTICLE VIII — EXPERIENCE SUBORDINATION
The interface exists to expose system reality. UI may not soften outcomes, conceal standing, or simulate progress. The interface is a window, not a playground.

### ARTICLE IX — INSTITUTIONAL VOICE
IRON communicates as a system, not a motivator. Language must be precise, non-sentimental, and consequence-oriented. Praise is replaced by confirmation.

### ARTICLE X — PRODUCT LAW
Retention is not a feature. It is the result of governance. Any component that does not strengthen behavioural authority violates this Constitution.
