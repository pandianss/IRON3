# IRON VISUAL CONSTITUTION (IVC-01)
## The Law of Appearance for Sovereign Systems

### PREAMBLE
IRON is not an application.
IRON is an institutional operating environment for human self-governance.

Therefore, every rendered surface of IRON must express:
• Authority over comfort
• Structure over decoration
• Permanence over trend
• Signal over ornament
• Sovereignty over usability theater

The visual system of IRON is a constitutional layer.
No interface may violate it.

### ARTICLE I — CHROMATIC ORDER (Color Law)
**I.1 — Color is Rank, Not Theme**
Color in IRON exists to encode institutional hierarchy and system state.
No color exists for branding. No color exists for decoration.
All colors must belong to one of four constitutional classes.

**I.2 — The Four Chromatic Classes**

**1. INFRASTRUCTURE (The Void)**
*   **Purpose**: substrate, silence, permanence.
*   **Characteristics**: Near-black, cold, neutral. Never pure black. Never warm.
*   **Examples**: `#050608`, `#0A0D12`, `#0E1116`
*   **Used for**: global background, system voids, root containers, uninhabited surfaces.
*   **Law**: Infrastructure must never compete for attention.

**2. STRUCTURE (The Material)**
*   **Purpose**: containment, separation, institutional framing.
*   **Characteristics**: Dark graphite, steel, ash. Low chroma. Slight spectral bias allowed.
*   **Used for**: panels, chambers, boundaries, rails, constitutional surfaces.
*   **Law**: Structure must always be perceptible without becoming luminous.

**3. SIGNAL (The Law Ink)**
*   **Purpose**: system meaning, status, breach, recovery, activation.
*   **Characteristics**: Cold high-clarity hues. Never neon. Never pastel. Never decorative.
*   **Canonical Signals**:
    *   Sovereignty / Active → cold cyan / pale electric blue
    *   Degradation / Breach → constrained crimson
    *   Recovery / Integrity → restrained viridian
*   **Used for**: borders, constitutional dividers, indicators, headings, critical text, standing marks.
*   **Law**: Signal color may never be the dominant surface color.

**4. FIELD (The Institutional Light)**
*   **Purpose**: atmospheric presence, system depth, non-literal illumination.
*   **Characteristics**: Radial or axial gradients. Extremely low opacity. Cold spectral bias. No visible color stops.
*   **Used for**: background fields only. never inside cards. never on buttons.
*   **Law**: Light in IRON is environmental, not decorative.

### ARTICLE II — LUMINANCE & LIGHT LAW
**II.1 — IRON Does Not Use Brightness. It Uses Depth.**
All contrast is achieved through: material separation, internal panel gradients, micro-luminance deltas, controlled institutional light fields.
Never through: white backgrounds, glowing UI, hard shadows, fashionable glassmorphism.

**II.2 — The Three Light Planes**
1.  **Void Plane**: root backgrounds, non-interactive, visually infinite.
2.  **Structural Plane**: panels, chambers, institutions, dashboards.
3.  **Signal Plane**: typography, rules, system events, telemetry.
These planes must never visually collapse.

**II.3 — Light as State**
Institutional light fields may reflect: sovereignty active, breach, recovery, suspended state.
They may never: animate playfully, decorate sections, imply delight.

### ARTICLE III — TYPOGRAPHIC CONSTITUTION
**III.1 — Typography is Jurisdiction**
Every font in IRON must belong to one of three jurisdictions.

**III.2 — The Three Jurisdictions**

**1. CONSTITUTIONAL**
*   **Purpose**: authority, permanence, declaration, charter presence.
*   **Used for**: IRON, section titles, constitutional artifacts, institutional headings.
*   **Qualities**: serif or semi-serif, vertical stress, high legibility, classical undertone.
*   **Examples**: Cinzel, Cormorant, EB Garamond, Libre Baskerville.
*   **Law**: Constitutional text must never be small, casual, or decorative.

**2. INSTITUTIONAL**
*   **Purpose**: explanation, operational language, user-system discourse.
*   **Used for**: paragraphs, labels, onboarding text, descriptions.
*   **Qualities**: neutral humanist sans, high x-height, engineering tone, no personality.
*   **Examples**: Inter, Source Sans 3, IBM Plex Sans.
*   **Law**: Institutional text must never look like marketing copy.

**3. SYSTEMIC**
*   **Purpose**: telemetry, kernel output, metrics, standing codes.
*   **Used for**: states, timers, audit logs, identifiers.
*   **Qualities**: monospaced, technically precise, non-rounded.
*   **Examples**: JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Space Mono.
*   **Law**: Systemic text must never be styled for friendliness.

**III.3 — Hierarchy is Mandatory**
There must be unmistakable typographic distinction between: declaration, instruction, system state.

### ARTICLE IV — SPATIAL & LAYOUT LAW
**IV.1 — IRON Interfaces Are Chambers, Not Pages**
IRON constructs institutional spaces. Every major surface must read as one of: an entry chamber, a constitutional hall, an operational command space, a recovery or audit chamber.
Never as: a website, a marketing page, a productivity dashboard.

**IV.2 — Structural Motifs**
Authorized: vertical sovereignty spines, sectional demarcation lines, anchored constitutional rails.
Prohibited: floating card grids, playful tiles, masonry layouts, trend-driven hero sections.

### ARTICLE V — PANEL & COMPONENT LAW
**V.1 — Panels Are Institutional Chambers**
Every panel must feel: installed, contained, governed, bounded.
Not: floating, modal, decorative, draggable toys.

**V.2 — Panel Requirements**
Each chamber must exhibit: a structural border or material break, a header zone or constitutional marker, internal depth, restrained luminance.

### ARTICLE VI — MOTION & EFFECTS LAW
**VI.1 — Motion is Mechanical, Not Emotional**
All motion must imply: state transition, system activation, constitutional shift.
Never: delight, bounce, playfulness, brand animation.

**VI.2 — Authorized Motions**
fades of authority, linear translations, slow field shifts, structural reveals.

### ARTICLE VII — PROHIBITIONS
The following are permanently unconstitutional:
*   Bright UI themes
*   Consumer app tropes
*   Social design language
*   Gamification aesthetics
*   Marketing hero design
*   Cheerful palettes
*   Emoji, mascots, illustrations
*   Glassmorphism / neumorphism

### ARTICLE VIII — SOVEREIGN TEST
“If this were leaked, would it look like a private institutional system — or a startup product?”
If the answer is “product,” it violates the constitution.

### ARTICLE IX — ENFORCEMENT
No component may be merged unless: chromatic class is identified, typographic jurisdiction is explicit, layout role is declared, chamber type is defined.

### CLOSING STATEMENT
IRON’s interface is not decoration.
It is the visible law of the system.
It must feel heavier than the user.
It must feel older than the session.
It must feel present even when idle.
